"Criterion" "Description" "Note"
"1." "Pain of recent onset" 
"2." "Pain associated with and in proportion to trauma, a pathologic process or movement/postural dys- function" 
"3." "History of nerve injury, pathology, or mechanical compromise" 
"4." "Pain disproportionate to the nature and extent of injury or pathology" 
"5." "Usually intermittent and sharp with movement/mechanical provocation; may be a more constant dull ache or throb at rest" 
"6." "More constant/unremitting pain" 
"7." "Pain variously described as burning, shooting, sharp, or electric-shock-like" 
"8." "Pain localized to the area of injury/dysfunction (with/without some somatic referral)" 
"9." "Pain referred in a dermatomal or cutaneous distribution" 
"10." "Widespread, nonanatomic distribution of pain" 
"11." "Clear, proportionate mechanical/anatomic nature to aggravating and easing factors" 
"12." "Mechanical pattern to aggravating and easing factors involving activities/postures associated with movement, loading, or compression of neural tissue" 
"13." "Disproportionate, nonmechanical, unpredictable pattern of pain provocation in response to multi- ple/nonspecific aggravating/easing factors" 
"14." "Reports of spontaneous (ie, stimulus-independent) pain and/or paroxysmal pain (ie, sudden recurrences and intensification of pain)" 
"15." "Pain in association with other dysesthesias (eg, crawling, electrical, heaviness)" 
"16." "Pain of high severity and irritability (ie, easily provoked, taking longer to settle)" 
"17." "Pain in association with other symptoms of inflammation (ie, swelling, redness, heat)" "Criteria 17 and 21 were not available in the data analysed in the article."
"18." "Pain in association with other neurological symptoms (eg, pins and needles, numbness, weakness)" 
"19." "Night pain/disturbed sleep" 
"20." "Responsive to simple analgesia/NSAIDs" 
"21." "Less responsive to simple analgesia/NSAIDs and/or more responsive to antiepileptic (eg, Lyrica)/antidepression (eg, Amitriptyline) medication" "Criteria 17 and 21 were not available in the data analysed in the article."
"22." "Usually rapidly resolving or resolving in accordance with expected tissue healing/pathology recovery times" 
"23." "Pain persisting beyond expected tissue healing/pathology recovery times" 
"24." "History of failed interventions (medical/surgical/therapeutic)" 
"25." "Strong association with maladaptive psychosocial factors (eg, negative emotions, poor self-eﬃcacy, maladaptive beliefs, and pain behaviors, altered family/work/social life, medical conflict)" 
"26." "Pain in association with high levels of functional disability" 
"27." "Antalgic (ie, pain relieving) postures/movement patterns" 
"28." "Clear, consistent, and proportionate mechanical/anatomic pattern of pain reproduction on move- ment/mechanical testing of target tissues" 
"29." "Pain/symptom provocation with mechanical/movement tests (eg, Active/Passive, Neurodynamic, ie, SLR) that move/load/compress neural tissue" 
"30." "Disproportionate, inconsistent, nonmechanical/nonanatomic pattern of pain provocation in response to movement/mechanical testing" 
"31." "Positive neurological findings (altered reflexes, sensation, and muscle power in a dermatomal/myotomal or cutaneous nerve distribution)" 
"32." "Localized pain on palpation" 
"33." "Diﬀuse/nonanatomic areas of pain/tenderness on palpation" 
"34." "Positive findings of allodynia within the distribution of pain" 
"35." "Positive findings of hyperalgesia (primary and/or secondary) within the distribution of pain" 
"36." "Positive findings of hyperpathia within the distribution of pain" 
"37." "Pain/symptom provocation on palpation of relevant neural tissues" 
"38." "Positive identification of various psychosocial factors (eg, catastrophization, fear-avoidance behavior, distress)"
