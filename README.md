# flexord

This is the github repository and R package accompanying the paper
"Ordinal clustering in the flex-scheme" (2025) by Ernst D, Ortega Menjivar L,
Scharl T, Gr√ºn B currently submitted to AJS.

This is currently still work in progress and some parts may not work at all
because they rely on unpublished changes to the `flexclust` package.
