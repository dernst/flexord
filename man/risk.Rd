\details{
The data was collected by academic researchers using a permission based
online panel.

The sample was taken from adult Australian residents who have undertaken
at least one holiday in the last year which involved staying away from
home for at least four nights.

The respondents were asked: “Which risks have you taken in the past?”
and answered on a 5-point scale with options:
\itemize{
\item Never (1)
\item Rarely (2)
\item Quite often (3)
\item Often (4)
\item Very often (5)
}

The six types of risk were:
\itemize{
\item Recreational risks (e.g. rock-climbing, scuba diving)
\item Health risks (e.g., smoking, poor diet, high alcohol consumption)
\item Career risks (e.g., quitting a job without another to go to)
\item Financial risks (e.g., gambling, risky investments)
\item Safety risks (e.g., speeding)
\item Social risks (e.g., standing for election, publicly challenging a rule or decision)
