\title{Low Back Pain Diagnoses and Diagnosis Criteria}
\format{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{data:}{A 464x11 binary matrix indicating the presence/absence of the
11 selected criteria for each of the 464 patients. Rownames are
study IDs.}
\item{group:}{A vector of length 464 indicating the diagnosis each patient
received, numerically coded (order has no meaning). The names of
the vector give the diagnosis in words.}
\item{index:}{The index to the criteria explaining which symptom they refer to.}

\description{
In a 2011 study, Smart et al. (2011) collected information on 464 Irish and
British patients suffering from low back pain regarding:
\itemize{
\item the type of low back pain (classified into "nociceptive", "peripheral
neuropathic", and "central neuropathic")
\item the presence/absence of 38 clinical criteria and symptoms relating to low
back pain.
}

Fop et al. (2017) conducted Latent Class Analysis on this data set to
retrieve the experts' classifications; and by comparing nested models they
were able to select 11 out of 38 criteria which contain the most of the
relevant grouping information while avoiding redundancy.
