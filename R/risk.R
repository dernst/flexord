#' `Recreational`, `Health`, `Career`, `Financial`, `Safety` and `Social`.

#' @details
#' The data was collected by academic researchers using a permission based
#' online panel.
#'
#' The sample was taken from adult Australian residents who have undertaken
#' at least one holiday in the last year which involved staying away from
#' home for at least four nights.
#'
#' The respondents were asked: “Which risks have you taken in the past?”
#' and answered on a 5-point scale with options:
#' - Never (1)
#' - Rarely (2)
#' - Quite often (3)
#' - Often (4)
#' - Very often (5)
#' 
#' The six types of risk were:
#' - Recreational risks (e.g. rock-climbing, scuba diving)
#' - Health risks (e.g., smoking, poor diet, high alcohol consumption)
#' - Career risks (e.g., quitting a job without another to go to)
#' - Financial risks (e.g., gambling, risky investments)
#' - Safety risks (e.g., speeding)
#' - Social risks (e.g., standing for election, publicly challenging a rule or decision)
